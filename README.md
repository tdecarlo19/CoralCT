This is a MATLAB script that is a public version of the primary CoralCT app (www.coralct.org). This public version has nearly all the same features and functions of the primary application, except there is no ability to create new usernames. To login, use any of the following usernames and passwords:

**username**	**password**

TestUser1 TestPassword1

TestUser2	TestPassword2

TestUser3	TestPassword3

TestUser4	TestPassword4

TestUser5	TestPassword5

TestUser6	TestPassword6

TestUser7	TestPassword7

TestUser8	TestPassword8

TestUser9	TestPassword9

TestUser10	TestPassword10

This public script is connected to an FTP server that works the same as the full server in the main application, except the server for this public app has only a subset of available cores. The purpose of this is to allow anyone to see the codes underlying the app and have some example cores to experiment with, if desired. However, the main server contains datasets that are pre-publication and the data owners have not elected for full public sharing yet. Thus, we cannot give the access credentials for the main server.
